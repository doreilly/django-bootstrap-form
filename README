Generate twitter-bootstrap form output for django forms.

A django template tag to work with twitter bootstrap ( http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/ )

There are three filters available:

bootstrap:
Outputs a single form object in bootstrap compliant markup.

bootstrapfield:
Outputs a single field in boostrap compliant markup. There are currently three templates
that determine how a field is marked up.

bootstrapformset:
Outputs a formset object into a table with bootstrap compliant markup.

Additionally, there is a javascript document (jQuery 1.7 or higher required) that can be
imported. Formsets will automatically be converted to include dynamic insertion, removal
and reordering of formset elements.

Installation:
Add 'bootstrapform' to INSTALLED_APPS.

Template usage:
{% load bootstrap %}

{{ form|bootstrap }}

or

{{ field|bootstrapfield }}

or

{{ formset|bootstrapformset }}

optionally with:

<script type="text/javascript" src="{{ STATIC_URL }}bootstrapform/js/bootstrap.formset.js"></script>
